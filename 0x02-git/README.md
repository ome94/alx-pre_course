# ALX Git Project

This is a hands-on project on the use of git and github. I wrote code locally and committes to [github](https://github.com/ome94/alx-pre_course)
In this set of tasks we used git and github to :
1. Create a new [Github repository](https://ithub.com/ome94/alx-pre_course).
2. Write this [README](./README.md)
3. Create files and folders which we commited in our local repository on the sandbox
4. Push the commited changes to Github
5. We also made changes to this README via the Github web interface.
